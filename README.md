# WIP
An Infusion 2 addon with two main goals:
1. Adding concrete and realistic infusions as opposed to magical and metaphorical ones like in the base mod or Infusion 2 Addon.
2. Interesting infusions to add depth to the procedural generation, like rapid-fire which turns any weapon into a machine gun and significantly reduces damage. There are many possible synergies with different combinations of infusions, or between weapons and infusions. All infusions ar still carefully balanced and provide different but not overarching ways of using weapons and apparel. 

## Content
New tiers:
- **tiered** - **negative**, **minor**, **moderate**, **major**, **extreme**, **record** - five tiers for infusions like small-big-large-huge-enormous.
- **modified** - items modified in a certain way, like spikes on blunt weapons, bacterial coating, etc.
- **repurposed** - infusions that reflect repurposing items for specific tasks, like armor focused on one kind of damage, turning any gun into a machine gun, adding EMP damage, making the weapon explosive, etc.
- A few more tiers are implemented but currently have no infusions.

There are currently 139 new infusions in the mod. Each infusion has a short description to add some lore.
