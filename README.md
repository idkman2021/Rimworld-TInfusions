# WIP
An Infusion 2 addon. The goal is to add concrete and realistic infusions as opposed to magical and metaphorical adjectives used in Infused 2. Each infusion has a small description for more lore.
New tiers:
- **tiered** - **negative**, **minor**, **moderate**, **major**, **extreme**, **record** - five tiers for infusions like small-big-large-huge-enormous.
- **broken** - a tier that only appears on awful items and makes them even more useless. Doesn't just include forms of breakage, for example there is a "toy" infusion planned.
- **modified** - items modified in a certain way, like bacterial coating, etc.
- **repurposed** - infusions that reflect repurposing items for specific tasks, like armor focused on one kind of damage, turning any gun into a machine gun, etc. Those are quite rare
- **artifacts** - very rare infusions with more weird stats and typically high market value.

Currently all tiers and over 80 tiered infusions are implemented.
