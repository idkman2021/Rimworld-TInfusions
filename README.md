# WIP
An Infusion 2 addon that adds interesting infusions to add depth to the procedural generation. There are many possible synergies with different combinations of infusions, or between weapons and infusions. All infusions ar still carefully balanced and provide different but not overarching ways of using weapons and apparel. 

Examples of already implemented infusions:
- rapid-fire - 4x faster firing speed and 4x less damage, works with any ranged weapon.
- toxic, frozen, burning, taser, electric, serrated, blunt, explosive etc. - add effects to the weapon, like raising toxic buildup, hypothermia, explosions, burning, blood loss, stun, changing damage types, and so on.
- a huge amount of more common infusions like small/big/large, slow/fast, blunt/sharp, short/long, light/heavy, cold/warm, uncomfortable/comfortable, ugly/cute/pretty, etc.
- 
There are currently over 150 new infusions in the mod.
